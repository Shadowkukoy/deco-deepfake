Note that metadata alone can be fickle, and is not in and of itself definitive proof of a deepfake. Normally, the upload process for videos will remove these differences, but ASIO can sometimes get special access to original files.\n\n1: Due to limitations in the deepfake creation process, deepfakes may have only 1 audio channel. Real videos will always have 2.\n2: Real videos will have frame dimensions of 1280x720 or 1920x1080.\n3: Real videos will tend to be recorded and then edited on separate occasions, especially if they are cut and uploaded to social media. Deepfakes, however, are often pre-cut before the video is made, resulting in the date created and the date modified being the same.",
